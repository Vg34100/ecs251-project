## Concurrency Benchmark Skeleton

### Meeting 1

- Repo skeleton + interfaces + placeholder runner.

    Run:
    - src/bench/Main.java

    Output:
    - total time to run placeholder tasks using a model



- IO- heavy workload
  1.  IO sleep workload: reproducible; highlights blocking/wait effects on scheduling.
  2. File read/write workload: due to OS caching; warm-up + multiple trials may be needed.
